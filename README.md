# Heart Disease Prediction System

This repository contains a project for predicting heart disease using machine learning. The system includes:
- A trained machine learning model for heart disease prediction.
- A Flask-based web application for user interaction.
- Educational resources about heart disease.

## Features
- **Web Interface:** User-friendly interface built with HTML templates.
- **Prediction Model:** A trained model using real-world data.
- **Educational Resources:** Informative sections to raise awareness about heart health.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main application script for running the web interface.
- `model_train.py`: Script used to train the machine learning model.
- `Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv`: Dataset used for training the model.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the web interface.
- `heart_disease_model.pkl`: Pre-trained model file.
- `user_data.db`: Database for storing user data.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
[   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
](https://github.com/birincib/heart-disease-prediction.git)
